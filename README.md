Timetable
=========

https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/timetable/

Description:
The "Timetable" is the perfect tool to manage your schedule week. Timetable is created for pupils and students, but by simple configuration can be adapted to other activities, which are performed with some regularity.
The application allows you to configure your own subjects, hours schedule, types activities. You can also save notes and add events and grades for each subject. By defining types, you can easily and quickly identify the type of activities, which after assigning type are highlighted one of the 12 available colors.
Simple settings allow you to select only those days that we have activities. The "AB" gives you the ability to configure two different plans, e.g. for the even and odd week.
If you have a problem, you have found a bug or request a feature, use the "Send Feedback".
If the application you like and want me to help, please send any amount of BTC to the address: 1NcavNKW3pf4kzkeqRC6JePpNCz79F82rK. If you want to help in any other way use the "Send Feedback".

JavaScript is my hobby and I'm still learning, so the code may appear bugs.
English isn't my native language, sorry for all the mistakes.
